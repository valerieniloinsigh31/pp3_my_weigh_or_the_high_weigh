<b>User Experience</b>

<b>Project Goals</b>
User Goals: Show the results of the weight loss programme on a weekly basis for six participants within a similar control group in order to advertise the programme 'My Weigh or the High Weigh'
User Stories:
-Distinctions
-Start weight versus end weight
-How effective is the weight loss programme
-What kind of setbacks occurred and what was the reason for them
-Did the supplements affect weight loss when all other factors were the same (reason behind this...water retention, muscles weighs the same as fat)
-What other metrics could be used...other feedback, comments

<b>Design Choices:</b>
Color scheme: Python format-how it will be viewed, does not allow for much design
Typography: Eye catching, energetic, clear
Want the data to be clear, not over crowded, confusing or muddled
Should be provocative and insightful

<b>Features</b>

<b>Existing Features</b>
Calcuate weight loss per participant on a weekly basis
Calculate weekly average week loss
Calculate week with greatest collective weight loss
Calculate week with lowest collective weight loss
Assess whether there was a disctintion between candidates who used supplements and who didn't

<b>Features Left to Implement</b>

Projected weight loss
Pie chart
Make estimations
Comments prompted once a candidate is selected, wherein they offer feedback on the week if massive variances from expectation are noted (I overate, I didn't make it to the gym, I had a wedding etc.)

<b>Minimum Viable Product Logic</b>
Building on the success of PP2, I decided to not overly complicate my choice of project and to build on the knowledge acquired in tutorials and the walk-through project to layer on further code (using the walkthrough project code input as boilerplate code and editing this) as opposed to trying to implement entirely new concepts and code. 
 Additionally, I committed to more interaction with slack and the various supports (tutor/mentor) on this project as it had helped me greatly in PP2.

   As advised, I took on the assessors recommentations from the PP2 feedback and applied the suggested improvements to this project.

   One of these recommendations, which I ensured to apply from the inception of PP3 was the ensuring the git commits were in imperative format. I received the following feedback from the assessor:

   'Going forward, ensure that all commit messages are in the imperative mood (Add…, Fix…, Style…, Edit…) and as descriptive as possible, within 50 characters, outlining the atomic change made. You can use the following link for reference on how to improve your commit messages - https://cbea.ms/git-commit/'

<b>Overview of the Project</b>
I decided to go with a blend between project 0 and project 1 in that it is a survey of sorts but a repeated, accurate survey that follows specific data of specific people with a view to aiding in the implementation and application of a wiehgt loss plan. More a monitoring tool that offers insights into how effective a weight loss programme is and informs the personal trainer and client about how effective their plan has been. As the purpose of the project is to offer drill down information into a weight loss programme that is assigned to six difference candidiates of a similar control profile (male, mid thirties, moderate level of activity, non-vegetarian, no food intolerances). Half of the candidiates took a daily dose of whey isolate protein and creatine and the other half did not and therefore attempts will be made to gain insights from whether supplementation aided in weight loss. Candidates offered weekly explanations for setbacks in the programme if applicable
